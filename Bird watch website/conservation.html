                <h2>Control invasive plants and animals</h2>
                <p>Mink and rats are a predator that threaten many bird species, 
                    for example by eating their eggs.

                <p>Phododendron is an example of an invasive plant which can very quickly 
                    take over large areas of countryside, disrupting the biodiversity.
